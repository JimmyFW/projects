I'm a recent grad of [Olin College](https://www.olin.edu), where I studied electrical engineering, software design, and user-centered research methodologies. Most recently I was a backend software engineer at [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/products/sales), making salespeoples' lives easier with creations like an out-of-office email detector and follow-up recommendations.

Previously, I designed and prototyped early versions of the [Brightbox]({{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio/1_project), first as a project engineer and then as a co-project manager. Brightbox has received funding through [Generosity](https://www.generosity.com/education-fundraising/hands-on-learning-in-stem-the-brightbox--2) and [Olin Crowdfund](https://fundit.olin.edu/project/1809).

I also [consulted](http://www.olin.edu/collaborate/scope/projects/2014_15/Ivani/) for [Ivani LLC](http://www.ivani.com) with a team of 5. In a year, we conceptualized and prototyped a [Smart Tagging system]({{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio/2_project) for electricians and building owners - now pending IP review!
