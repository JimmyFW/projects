In my senior year of college, I worked with a team of six on a capstone project sponsored by <a href="http://www.ivani.com/">Ivani</a>, an energy technology start-up. The prompt was open-ended: create a new product for Ivani's corporate partners in the construction and manufacturing sectors.

	About the team.

<p>
We spent the first semester immersing ourselves in the types of problems encountered by Ivani's partners. After narrowing down our concept gallery and running business analysis on a select few proposals, the team and Ivani jointly selected a project to move forward with.

<p>
We built a functional prototype in the second semester and submitted the invention for patent review.
