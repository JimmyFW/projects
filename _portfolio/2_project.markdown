Lack of documentation is currently one of the largest problems facing electricians and leads to longer maintenance times and potential costly errors for building owners.

Solution: a smart tagging system to help electricians and building owners track important information about electrical components such as the operating characteristics of the component, what the component is attached to, and the maintenance history of the component.

Our design makes it simple to implement new data types in future iterations such as the approximate GPS coordinates of a tag.
