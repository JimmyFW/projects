I worked on earlier versions of the Brightbox before it became project Child Education in Olin's [Affordable Design and Entrepreneurship](http://design.olin.edu/courses/ade/) capstone. After I graduated, I advised the new team as project ownership was being transferred over.

The idea behind this educational toy is simple - three beams of light shine onto a board. Grade-school children, equipped with a kit of lenses, mirrors, and prisms, engage in hands-on activities and learn the principles of optics.
